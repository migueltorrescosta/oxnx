# oxnx
Student written template solutions for the C5.4 Networks course.

# Goal
To have template solutions of all questions in the lecture notes, so that having not worked with Python before does not slow down your learning curve. After all, the course is about Netowrks and not Python :)	

# Accessing the pdf files

The usual approach to coding is: Write whatever code solves the problem, no matter how inefficient. Find ways of simplifying the code. Repeat. And learn the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

1. Install Python3 and [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install) in your laptop.
2. Install Git (and learn about [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
3. Clone the repo.
4. Create a new branch from master.
5. Make local changes to the jupyter notebooks.
6. Run 'jupyter nbconvert --to pdf [notebook name]' for each notebook you changed in order to generate the respective pdf
7. Run 'git push'
8. Make a merge request from your branch to the master branch
